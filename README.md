"Processed scRNAseq data (10x) of uninjured mouse Patellar tendon"
This package contains the processed 10X Genomics scRNA-seq data from Harvey et al. (2019), which were processed as described in the paper, and at its repository on Github. This includes gene counts, cell annotation, and reduced-dimension representations for the atlas. 

"Processed bulk RNA-seq data from FACS-isolated sorting of mouse Patellar tendon subpopulations in uninjured and regenerated settings"
This package contains the bulk RNA-seq data from Harvey et al. (2019), which were processed as described in the paper, and its repository on Github. This includes differential expression analysis for the indicated sub-populations as they appear in the paper.
